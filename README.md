# Weather Application

Weather forecasting is very necessary for our daily lives. It helps us to prepare and make plans depending on the expectations. Many weather stations are placed around the world fetching real-time weather elements’ data.

This data includes six elements, such as precipitation, wind, atmospheric pressure, cloudiness, and temperature. With these, you can analyze trends and know the prediction of tomorrow’s data or forecast the weather.

Most of these large chunks of data are processed at base stations using powerful and sophisticated systems. They then share this data, (either analyzed over a long time or real-time data) through APIs. Companies that do this includes OpenWeatherMap and Dark Sky.
